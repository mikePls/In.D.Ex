Error metrics:
Sum of Squared Errors (SSE):
Measures distance between truth values and predictions

Total Sum of Square (TSS):
Measures distance between truth and the average values of the truth
AKA total variation around the mean of the outcome variable

Coefficient of Determination (R^2):
Explained variation of model
formula: 1-SSE/TSS
